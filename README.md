# Rubix Cube Solver

Something to keep me entertained through the final throes of lockdown #3 in the UK. Uses some of the skills I have theoretically gained from the AI MSc I'm currently studying for. 

The plan:

- In Python: work out a sensible way of modelling a rubix cube, and the available moves. Make sure it is easily interpretable (maybe some 90s style ASCII art output for MVP?)
- Work out the best way to solve this. Using an MDP? Q-learning? Something else? 
- Do we need to build in some tacit knowledge, e.g. strategies at each stage? Or - better - can we let the algorithm learn with no prior knowledge? 
- Build a simple web interface to show the magic happening. 
- Bonus points: use WebGL to show it in 3D.
